# Mobile_Student
An Android mobile application developed to provide students at
the tertiary level -- university, and (most) other levels a
solution to installing multiple apps and navigating in
and out of each while trying to do something as simple
as calculating, writing short notes, listening to podcasts,
opening audio/video tutorials, drawing a sketch, setting
up a schedule for lectures/tutorials.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to provide a multi-purpose,
all-in-one environment for students to accomplish their
simple, daily tasks like calculating simple arithmetic, listening to podcasts & other audio files, watching video
tutorials and writing notes.
